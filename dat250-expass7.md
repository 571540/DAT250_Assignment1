# Assignment 7 Short Report

## Experiment 1

I downloaded RabbitMQ by manually installing rabbitmq-server-3.8.9 and Erlang/OTP 23.1.

## Experiement 2-4

I first wanted to do these in Java, but got several errors when ran them in the terminal. I then tried Python and that worked well, so went with that rest of the way.
