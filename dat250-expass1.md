# Assignment 1 Report

This is a short report that explains the process of installing the assignment's required tools, following the start-up guide for Heroku and the different problems that happened during the task.

## Setting Up Software Development Environment

I already had all of these tools installed. The only thing I did was making sure I had the latest version for all of them, which was'nt the case. I used the command-line to check which version I had of Java and Maven for instance. I also downloaded the 2020-version of Eclipse. I made sure Maven was indeed in the PATH, which it was and I already had a GitHub account. All in all, there where noe problems completing this part of the assignment.

## Following the Heroku tutorial

Following the tutorial went fine for the most part. I did a few trail-and-error mistakes on the way, but that was mostly me misunderstanding a few things when I typed in some of the commands. Eventully it worked. I ended up adding my credit card so I could use the papertrail add-on, but I deleted my card-information again after I was done with the whole tutorial. This also meant that I had to remove the add-on again. At the very end I was supposed to use the "heroku pg:psql"-command which did'nt work for me. I installed PostgreSQL on my computer about 2 years ago, but maybe it was'nt setup right. I tried to fix it, but did not find a solution and was the only part I decided to skip. Except the very last part, I was able to get through the "Getting Started" guide.
